Despite extensive exploration of more powerful multi-object tracking (MOT) frameworks, the impact of frequent occlusion has remained a formidable challenge. 
In this work, we present a novel MOT framework with Authenticity Hierarchizing and Occlusion Recovery (AHOR), that strikingly handles occlusion and demonstrates superior precision and adaptability. 
Specifically, through an in-depth analysis of the classical tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, we fully upgrade three aspects. 
Firstly, we propose an Existence Score that provides a more accurate depiction of detection authenticity under occlusion, enhancing the effectiveness and robustness of the hierarchical association. 
Secondly, we present an ingeniously devised pre-processing method in conjunction with a Recovery Intersection over Union (RIoU) for location similarity measurement, addressing the adverse effects of occlusion-induced disparity between visible and true object regions. 
Lastly, we introduce an Occluded Person Re-identification Module (ODReID) that extracts appearance features from the restricted visible region, overcoming the critical dependence on object quality. 
Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that our AHOR achieves state-of-the-art performance on MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack, and VisDrone test sets.
