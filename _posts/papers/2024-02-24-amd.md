Predictive learning models for unannotated spatiotemporal data pose significant challenges, especially due to the highly entangled visual dynamics in real-world scenes. 
Our novel Appearance-Motion Disentanglement (AMD) approach, distinct from existing recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods, effectively addresses these challenges. 
AMD decouples appearance feature extraction and motion flow estimation within latent space. 
For appearance, we propose the Spectral-Aware Augmentation (SAA) module, designed to enhance and preserve appearance details in the frequency domain. 
For motion, we present the Mamba Motion Predictor (MMP), a lightweight spatiotemporal State Space Model (SSM) aimed at accurately estimating complex many-to-many motion relationships between patches. 
These designs ensure appearance consistency while also capturing intricate long-term motion patterns with a lower computational cost. 
Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that AMD outperforms state-of-the-art methods with multi-scenario examinations, including human motions, synthetic motions, driving scenes, traffic flow, and global climate.
